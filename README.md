# Ecommerce_Data_Analysis_With_SQL_In_Python
This project combines SQL and Python in a Jupyter Notebook to analyze e-commerce data.  Using datasets like Customers, Orders, Order Items, Payments, Products, Sellers, and  Geolocations, SQL queries are executed within Python to extract insights on customer behavior,  sales trends, and product performance.

## 📌 Project Overview
The analysis uses multiple CSV datasets mimicking a real-world e-commerce platform, including:
- 👥 `customers.csv` – Customer IDs and location details  
- 🌍 `geolocations.csv` – Geographic coordinates of customer and seller locations  
- 📦 `orders.csv` – Order dates, statuses, and customer IDs  
- 📄 `order_items.csv` – Product quantities, prices, and order-level details  
- 💳 `payments.csv` – Payment methods and amounts  
- 🛍️ `products.csv` – Product IDs, categories, and names  
- 🏪 `sellers.csv` – Seller IDs and location data

SQL queries are written and executed using Python (e.g., SQLite or pandasql), allowing efficient data filtering, joining, aggregation, and visualization.


## 🧠 Key Features
- ✅ SQL queries run directly in Python via libraries like `sqlite3` or `pandasql`  
- ✅ Complex joins across multiple tables for holistic analysis  
- ✅ Insights into total sales, top-selling products, and delivery performance  
- ✅ Analysis of payment types and customer distribution  
- ✅ Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`


## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Run and integrate SQL queries within a Python environment  
- Perform EDA on structured relational datasets  
- Understand data relationships in an e-commerce setting  
- Use both SQL logic and Python plotting for storytelling


## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Microsoft SQL Server**  
- **pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**
